# AVD Arista Validated Design for Arista Test Drive (Level 3/CVP Lab Edition)

## About

This repository is configured to run [`arista.cvp`](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp) & [`arista.avd`](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd) ansible collections against the Arista Test Drive (ATD) Topology (specifically the Level 3/CVP topology).

# Setup Your Environment

### Clone this Repository
Make sure you're in the persist directory, then clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tonybourkesdnpros/AVD-Level3

### Install Components
You will need to run these commands every time your lab environment starts up (most of the Linux system isn't persistent across reboots)

    ansible-galaxy collection install arista.eos
    ansible-galaxy collection install arista.cvp
    ansible-galaxy collection install arista.avd
    ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
    pip3 install cvprac --upgrade

# Reset Lab Environment to Default

### Add Lab Credentials

edit credentials in vscode: atd-inventory/inventory.yml 

(put your lab password in for ansible_password and ansible_ssh_pass)

### Run Playbook to Prepare CloudVision for AVD

The atd-reset-labs playbook will pull off any configlets that are not part of the base configuration (ATD-INFRA and switch-base configlets). It will also place the spines and leafs in the default containers, in case you've moved them for any reason. (Note: if you're using Studios, you need to de-provision all switches from Studios, as only Studios can remove Studios-generated configlets). 

    ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-reset-labs.yml
    
### Execute Tasks in CVP manually

The playbook will create tasks, but not a change control, so create a change control with the open tasks and execute the change control. 

# Build the Fabric

Run the fabric deploy playbook

    ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-deploy.yml 

This will take about 2-3 minutes, and will create a series of tasks in CloudVision. When the playbook is complete, create a change control from these tasks and execute it (you may see some errors, that's OK). 

Verify the fabric is configured
    show ip bgp summary
    show bgp evpn summary

## Run the other playbooks

# Run audit playbook to validate Fabric states
    ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-validate-states.yml

# Execute EOS_SNAPSHOT role to collect show commands
    ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-snapshot.yml
